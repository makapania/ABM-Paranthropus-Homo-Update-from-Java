- **Grid system** (81 x 101 toroidal grid)
- **Time management** (minutes → days → seasons → years)
- **Agent creation** with species-specific attributes
- **Data collection** framework for output

### 2. **Plant Food System** ✓ 
- **PlantSpecies class** (`plant_system.py`)
  - 27 species loaded from Excel
  - Return rates calculated (calories/minute)
  - Tool requirements (digging)
  - Species-specific edibility (boisei vs ergaster)
  - Seasonal fruiting (4 seasons)
  
- **CellFood class** (`plant_system.py`)
  - Food availability per cell
  - Topography-based distribution (channel/flooded/unflooded)
  - Consumption tracking
  - Growth/decay dynamics (partial)

### 3. **Agent Foraging Behavior** ✓
- **Scanning** for food in current cell
- **Detection** (probabilistic visibility)
- **Optimal foraging** (choose highest return rate)
- **Eating** mechanics (gut capacity, calories)
- **Movement** (random for now)
- **Activity logging** (eating, traveling)

### 4. **Plant Growth Dynamics** ✓
- **Verhulst equation** implemented in `CellFood.update_food()`
- **Logistic growth** during fruiting seasons

- **Individual vs cooperative** scavenging based on carcass size
- **Meat consumption** with caloric values and gut capacity

## 🚧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

### Priority 1: Excel Parameter Loading (~30 min)

#### A. **Seasonal Fruiting Patterns** (plant_system.py)
Current state: All plants fruit all seasons (hardcoded)  
**TODO in `load_plant_species()` function:**

```python
# Currently at line ~170:
params['seasons_fruiting'] = [True, True, True, True]  # TEMPORARY

# Need to load from Excel columns (find column indices for seasons 1-4)
# Look for columns like "fruits season 1", "fruits season 2", etc.
# Update to:
params['seasons_fruiting'] = [
    sheet.cell_value(row, season1_col) == 'Y',
    sheet.cell_value(row, season2_col) == 'Y',
    sheet.cell_value(row, season3_col) == 'Y',
    sheet.cell_value(row, season4_col) == 'Y',
]
```

#### B. **Return Rate Calculations** (plant_system.py)
Current state: Using placeholder values  
**TODO in `load_plant_species()` function:**

```python
# Currently using defaults:
params.setdefault('grams_per_feeding_unit', 100.0)
params.setdefault('calories_per_gram', 2.0)
params.setdefault('visibility_probability', 0.7)
params.setdefault('handling_time_minutes', 5.0)

# Need to find and load these columns from Excel:
# - Look for column headers containing "grams", "calories", "handling", "visibility"
# - Map to correct column indices
# - Load actual values from sheet
```

### Priority 2: Enhanced Movement Algorithm (~30 min)

**TODO in `HominidAgent.move_toward_food()` method:**

```python
def move_toward_food(self):
    """
    Implement diagonal-first movement from original model.
    
    TODO:
    1. Scan all 8 neighboring cells
    2. Evaluate food availability in each
    3. Move to cell with best prospects
    4. If no good food, wander in random direction
    5. Use wandering_distance parameter for escape behavior
    
    See original Java: Agent.java lines 1200-1400
    """
    pass
```

### Priority 3: Performance Optimization (~30 min)

**Current performance:** 1 day takes ~12 seconds with 10 agents  
**Optimization opportunities:**
- Cache food availability calculations
- Only update plant growth once per day, not every minute
- Use numpy arrays instead of dictionaries where possible
- Optimize carcass detection algorithms

## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND

### Optimal Foraging Theory
Agents always choose food with **highest return rate** (calories per minute).

```python
# In HominidAgent.choose_best_food():
best_food = max(viable_options, key=lambda s: s.return_rate)
```

**This is the core of the model.**

### Toroidal Grid
Grid wraps at edges (like Pac-Man):
```python
self.grid = MultiGrid(width, height, torus=True)
```

### Time Structure
```
1 year = 365 days
1 day = 720 minutes (12 hours active)
4 seasons = roughly 90 days each
```

### Starvation
Tracked by daily calorie history:
```python
# In HominidAgent.check_starvation():
if N consecutive days < threshold% of daily needs:
    agent starves
```

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & QUICK FIXES

### Issue 1: Performance
**Problem:** 1 day takes ~9 seconds with 10 agents  
**Solution:** This is acceptable, but can be optimized:
- Cache food availability calculations
- Only update plant growth once per day, not every minute
- Use numpy arrays instead of dictionaries where possible

### Issue 2: Data Collection
**Problem:** CellFood agents get included in data collection  
**Status:** Fixed with isinstance() checks in reporters  
**If problems persist:** Filter in `_get_results()` method

### Issue 3: Missing Excel Columns
**Problem:** Some plant parameters use defaults  
**Solution:** 
1. Open parameters.xls in Excel/LibreOffice
2. Look at "voi plant parameters" sheet
3. Find column headers
4. Update column indices in `load_plant_species()`

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### If you have 30 minutes:
1. Load real seasonal fruiting patterns from Excel
2. Load actual return rate parameters from Excel
3. Test parameter loading improvements

### If you have 1 hour:
1. All of above
2. Implement diagonal-first movement algorithm
3. Test enhanced movement behavior

### If you have 2+ hours:
1. All of above
2. Performance optimization
3. Create visualization tools
4. Validate against original results
5. Add advanced analysis features

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST

### Quick Test (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /path/to/files
python test_model.py
```

### Full 1-Year Test (30-60 minutes)
```python
from hominids_model import HOMINIDSModel

model = HOMINIDSModel(
    params_file='parameters.xls',
    landscape='voi',
    n_boisei=10,
    n_ergaster=0,
    boisei_options='bid',  # individual, digging
    n_years=1,
    random_seed=42
)

results = model.run()
print(f"Simulation complete!")
print(f"Agent data: {len(results['agent_data'])} records")
```

### Validate Results
Check that agents:
- ✓ Gain calories (2500/day for boisei)
- ✓ Move around landscape
- ✓ Prefer high-return-rate foods
- ✓ Track in Season 4 (difficult season)

## 💡 DEBUGGING TIPS

### Print statements are your friend:
```python
# In HominidAgent.eat_food():
print(f"Agent {self.unique_id} ate {plant_species.name}, "
      f"gained {calories_gained:.0f} kcal, "
      f"total today: {self.calories_today:.0f}")
```

### Check food availability:
```python
# In model step:
if self.current_minute == 0 and self.current_day % 10 == 0:
    total_food = sum(cf.food_amounts.values() 
                    for cf in self.grid.get_all_cell_contents() 
                    if isinstance(cf, CellFood))
    print(f"Day {self.current_day}: Total food = {total_food}")
```

### Monitor agent state:
```python
# After model.step():
for agent in model.hominid_agents:
    print(f"Agent {agent.unique_id}: "
          f"pos={agent.pos}, calories={agent.calories_today:.0f}, "
          f"gut={agent.gut_contents_grams:.0f}g")
```
